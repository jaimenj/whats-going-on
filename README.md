## Description

A very simple plugin for WordPress that allows you to see all real requests to your website. Itâ€™s a WAF, a Web Application Firewall that is installed in the frontend of WordPress. Itâ€™s installed in the server with the plugin, and it checks requests from the web browsers, bots or webcrawlers to your WordPress. It executes the WAF codes before every request to PHP files of WordPress, so it also works before every request to the WordPress cache.

## Uninstall

1. Deactivate the plugin into the Plugins menu in the admin panel of WordPress.
2. Delete into the Plugins menu.

All the options configured into the plugin are removed when plugin is deleted, not when plugin is deactivated. All the database tables are removed when plugin is deactivated. So if you want to remove the plugin and all data stored, first deactivate the plugin and then remove it from the plugin admin zone into the WordPress backend.

## Frequently Asked Questions

* Can I block myself?

Yes. By default, you cannot block yourself while you are activating the plugin. But be careful while setting restrictions for the firewall. 

* I blocked myself, how can I disable it without access to the backend?

In case of emergency, you can remove the file .user.ini and the directory /wp-content/plugins/whats-going-on/. Maybe you also want to restart PHP-fpm or Apache/Nginx if WAF is cached.
