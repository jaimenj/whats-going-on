## Description

A very simple firewall for WordPress that allows you to see all real requests to your WordPress and protect you from Internet attacks. Itâ€™s a WAF, a Web Application Firewall that is installed in front of WordPress. Itâ€™s installed in the server with the plugin, and it checks requests from the web browsers, bots or webcrawlers to your WordPress. It executes the WAF codes before every request to PHP files of WordPress, so it also works before every request to the WordPress cache.

Alternative install with SSH:

1. Goto the plugins directory doing: cd /wp-content/plugins/
2. Clone the GitHub repository doing: git clone git@github.com:jaimenj/whats-going-on.git

With SSH you can stay up to date using the normal git pull command.

## Uninstall

1. Uninstall .user.ini file.
2. Deactivate the plugin into the Plugins menu in the admin panel of WordPress.
3. Delete into the Plugins menu.

All the options configured into the plugin are removed when plugin is deleted, not when plugin is deactivated. All the database tables are removed when plugin is deactivated. So if you want to remove the plugin and all data stored, first deactivate the plugin and then remove it from the plugin admin zone into the WordPress backend.

## Frequently Asked Questions

* Can I block myself?

You cannot block yourself while you are activating the plugin. But you can block yourself while setting restrictions for the firewall. First read carefully and config it slowly, testing configurations and showing the results.

* I blocked myself, how can I disable it without access to the backend?

If something is broken because of this WAF, edit and empty the files /waf-going-on.php and /wp-content/plugins/whats-going-on/waf-going-on.php. Do not remove it, you can rename it and make an empty one with the same name. It will continue working, but doing nothing.
